Contributing
============

If you would like to contribute code you can do so through GitHub by forking
the repository and sending a pull request.

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions
and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible.

If somebody wants to write some automated tests that grab screenshots on all 
the different OSes, for zero matched records, three matched records and five
matched records (the maximum), that would be awesome!
